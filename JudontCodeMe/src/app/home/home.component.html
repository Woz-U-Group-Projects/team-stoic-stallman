                <p>The team of North Korea wonâ€™t be a part of the World Championships in Tokyo. Last year North Korean was part of the bronze mixed team in a first unified team with five judoka from the South and one judoka from the North for the mixed team
                    event. At first place two men and six women were selected for the 2019 World Championships, but the North Korea have cancelled its planned participation in the World Judo Championships to be held from August 25 at Tokyo's Budokan.
                    North Korea was expected to send a three-member delegation, including vice sports minister Won Kil U, to the seminar to be held in the Japanese capital next week. The Japan Olympic Committee will use the occasion to provide officials
                    from Olympic committees of countries and regions participating in the Olympics with information about the Olympic venues and other facilities. The Japanese government has said that it will give the North Korean delegation permission
                    to attend the seminar as an exception from Japan's sanctions that bans North Korean nationals in principle from entering the country. Informed sources say that the North Korean side notified Japan of its decision to cancel the trip.
                    Men's lightweight Yong Gwon Kim finished seventh last year in Baku and was again in the draft selection. North Korea has agreed with the International Olympic Committee on a plan to form joint teams with South Korea in four sports
                    categories including judo for the Tokyo Games. These were the athletes that were selected, but will have to stay home: U60: Jae Yong An and Yong Gwon Kim U48: Yu Sun Jon and Jong Hung Kim U52: Song Sim Rim U57: Hyo Sun Ri and Jin A
                    Kim U70: Sun Yong Kwon</p>
