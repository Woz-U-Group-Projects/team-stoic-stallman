        <h4>This is prohibited Waza.</h4>

        <h4>Details</h4>
        <p>
            Tori breaks uke's balance towards his rear from the left side of uke's body, and while dropping down onto one side, he puts the right leg on uke's lower abdomen and the left leg on the back of uke's knees and reaps his lower body in a scissor-like action,
            but so that he is thrown backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Positioned beside Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack), Tori (Player executing technique) grasps the back of Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) collar with his Tsurite (Lifting hand). While supporting himself by placing his Hiki-te (Tsurite
            [Lifting hand]) against the floor, Tori (Player executing technique) raises both legs and scissors Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) upper body with them. In this "scissors" posture, one of Tori (Player executing technique) legs is
            positioned behind Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) knees, and the other leg is at Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) abdominal area. Tori (Player executing technique) then twists his waist to rotate both is legs in the backward
            direction, and topples Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) in that direction. Tori (Player executing technique) performs this leg reap while pulling Uke (Player receiving opponent's attack) backward with his Tsurite (Lifting hand). Due
            to the force of the fall which this Waza produces, and due to the high risk of strong back-of-the-head impacts against the floor which could even result in death, this is a prohibited Waza. The four Waza which are currently prohibited by the
            international rules are the Kani-basami (Scissors throw), Ashi-garami (Entangled leg lock), Do-jime (Body scissors), and the Kawazu-gake (One-leg entanglement drop).

        <p>Diane Tamai Jackson, godan, began judo at age seven. Her first sensei was her father, Ken Tamai, at the Hui-o judo club in Maryland, and she grew up competing in shiai. As an adult, she has been a member of over ten US teams in international judo
            kata competition, including the Kodokan International Kata Invitational, Cuban Olympics, Pan American Championships, and four World Judo Kata Championships. She has also won multiple medals in kata at the open World Masters Judo Championships.
            Diane was most recently the 2016 Ju-no-kata Pan-American gold medalist in 2015 & 2016 kata grand champion in the mixed division at the Senior National Championships. Diane is an active volunteer for judo, as a National-level referee, National-level
            kata judge, member of the Shufu region Board of Examiners, Chair of the Kata Committee for the Shufu region, and an assistant instructor at Hui-o judo club in Beltsville, Maryland.</p>
        <p>“I loved shiai growing up and I still love shiai. I learned confidence, compassion and perseverance, in judo and in life. But my understanding and appreciation for judo expands as I study the katas. As a young student, I never dreamed of competing
            at the Kodokan for the USA, but I was fortunate to have that opportunity in 2007 competing in the Kodokan International Kata Invitational. Judo is truly a life-long journey.“</p>
